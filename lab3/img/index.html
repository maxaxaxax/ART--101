		<h1>Lab3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We didn't know how to line break in html and found the solution by looking up the information. We didn't know what to write in the copy and finally decided to simply introduce ourselves. Also, Sunny likes the pink style, while Max doesn't like it too much. Another problem is, we were both pretty tired when we doing this work so we had a hard time to keep ourselves concerntrated.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Finally, we used the pink style for the main page. We did a phone call to keep ourselves concentrated and keep using searching tools to solve problems. Here is the structures we made:</p>
